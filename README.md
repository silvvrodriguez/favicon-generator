# Favicon Generator Multi-Format

Generate all the favicon formats you need from a single image — everything runs directly in the browser.

This tool was built to make favicon generation easier when working on small to medium projects, without relying on multiple external tools.

## [Live Demo](https://silvvrodriguez.github.io/favicon-generator/) 

## Features

- Upload PNG, JPG, or SVG images
- Generate multiple sizes, from 16×16 up to 512×512
- Runs entirely in the browser (no backend)
- Download a ZIP with all generated icons
- Copy a ready-to-use HTML snippet
- Preview icons before downloading

## Quick Start

1. Upload an image (drag & drop or click to browse)
2. Select the sizes you need (or use presets like **All** or **PWA**)
3. Click **Generate**
4. Download the ZIP or copy the HTML snippet
5. Done

## What You Get

The generated output may include:

- `favicon-16x16.png` — Browser tab icon  
- `favicon-32x32.png` — Taskbar icon  
- `favicon-48x48.png` — Windows site icon  
- `favicon-180x180.png` — Apple touch icon  
- `favicon-192x192.png` — Android Chrome icon  
- `favicon-512x512.png` — High-resolution PWA icon

## Tips for Best Results
