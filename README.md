# Favicon Generator Multi-Format

Generate all the favicon formats you need from a single image — and everything runs in the browser.

This tool was built to simplify generating favicon sets for projects without having to juggle multiple generators or tools.

## Features

- Upload any image — PNG, JPG, or SVG
- Generate multiple sizes, from 16×16 up to 512×512
- Instant generation — all processing happens in your browser
- Download a ZIP with all icons and supporting files
- Copy ready-to-use HTML code
- Preview how your favicon looks before downloading

## Quick Start

1. Upload your image (drag & drop or click to browse)
2. Select the sizes you want (or choose presets like “All” or “PWA”)
3. Click **Generate**
4. Download the ZIP or copy the HTML snippet
5. Done!

## What You Get

When you generate favicons, you’ll receive:

- `favicon-16x16.png` — Browser tab icon  
- `favicon-32x32.png` — Taskbar icon  
- `favicon-48x48.png` — Windows site icon  
- `favicon-180x180.png` — Apple touch icon  
- `favicon-192x192.png` — Android Chrome icon  
- `favicon-512x512.png` — High-res PWA splash  
- HTML code snippet for your `<head>`

## 🛠 Built With

- Vanilla JavaScript – no frameworks, pure JS
- Canvas API – for image processing
- JSZip – to create downloadable ZIP files
- CSS3 – modern styling

## Tips for Best Results

- Use square images (1:1 aspect ratio)
- A minimum of 512×512 pixels is recommended
- Simple designs work better at smaller sizes (e.g., 16×16)
- Test your favicon in both light and dark browser themes

## Known Limitations

- Very small source images might look blurry in 16×16
- Some complex SVG graphics may render slightly differently across browsers
